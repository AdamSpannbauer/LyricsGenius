# To Do list for my GeniusAPI project


  1. Train a classifier on lyrics from many rappers. Then you give it a new song lyric (a whole song or one line?) and see if it can identify the rapper.
  2. Get a list of the 'best' hip-hop artists from all time and bulid a corpus by downloading all of their lyrics
  3. Automatically identify texts downloaded from Genius that aren't actually song lyrics (they include interviews and stuff and still call them songs.).
