# To Do list for my GeniusAPI project


  1. Train a classifier on lyrics from many rappers. Then you give it a new song lyric (a whole song or one line?) and see if it can identify the rapper.
  2. Get a list of the 'best' hip-hop artists from all time and bulid a corpus by downloading all of their lyrics
  3. Automatically identify texts downloaded from Genius that aren't actually song lyrics (they include interviews and stuff and still call them songs.).
  4. Find a list online that identifies the genre of songs I download
  5. Add a function to save an artist or song artist to disk (stored as .txt file)
  6. Write a GeniusAPI.py module containing the API and Song, Artist, classes

    -- Maybe the class definitions would be separate files eventually        
    -- The GeniusAPI module should retain script functionality, e.g. "python GeniusAPI.py --search_song 'Yesterday' 'The Beatles'
